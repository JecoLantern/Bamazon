# Bamazon

BAmazon is a CLI app that resembles an Amazon-like storefront. The app will take in orders from the displayed list of items and deplete stock from the store's inventory. The app can track product sales across the store's departments.

This project uses Node.js, MySQL as data input and storage, as well as other NPM packages to run the app.

To execute from the command line, type:
1) node BamazonCustomer.js --for customer side of the app
2) node BamazonManager.js --for manager side of the app
